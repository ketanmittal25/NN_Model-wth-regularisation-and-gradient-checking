# NN_Model-wth-regularisation-and-gradient-checking
The NN model in this project uses the advanced concepts of normalisation, regularisation and graident checking. Firstly, in order to reduce the variance effect and then to get a greater accuracy and not falling prey to any faulty line codes or gradient descent mistakes.
